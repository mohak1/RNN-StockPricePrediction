# RNN-StockPricePrediction
This RNN is trained on real stock price data of Google and tries to predict the price of stock in next time-step. It uses the LSTM model because stock prices depend on time which is a constantly changing quantity.
Understanding that stock prices depend on a lot of things like economic conditions, value of currency, market share of the company and many other things, this project takes in consideration only the opening and closing of the price each day and tries to make a prediction hence evaluation of accuracy is out of question but it does manage to model quite correctly the trends of the training sample.
